                <li>interning at Facebook on the core payments infra team (Summer 2019), previously at LinkedIn on the ETL infra team (Fall 2018), as well as at Yahoo working on the Daily Fantasy Sports and Yahoo Fantasy Slate platforms/products, and at SAP on the HANA Database Explorer team.</li>
                <li>(3B) software engineering student at the University of Waterloo (graduating class of 2021).</li>
                <li>huge sports fan - hockey (Sens), basketball (Raps), ... football (9ers), tennis (RF), ... baseball (Jays ... but 2015/2016 seasons only really), soccer (kinda, big events only), golf (kinda)</li>
                <li>enjoy travelling (kinda, although I find staying in one place for even as long as a week is pretty hard as a pure tourist) and hiking; ...

              <p>Tech-ish:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>crowdsourcing in tech/+wisdom of the crowd in statistics</li>
                <li>passwords, authentication, cryptography, faceid, touchid, ...</li>
                <li>trusting human judgement (doctors, drivers, etc.) vs tech algorithms - inherent algorithmic vs human bias</li>
                <li>tinder is the best example of pure user experience design ever - swiping left and right as an interaction was perfect for the fit</li>
                <li>I'm deep in the apple trap - bought an apple watch - only works with ios, so gotta get iphone next time i upgrade phones, there's a gamification of having a complete "set" - airpods, watch, phone, ipad, macbook, ...; airpods and apple watch offers only the slightest convenience upgrades (not having to take headphones out from laptop to go to washroom while sitting at desk at home, not typing password for unlocking macbook), but slight convenience upgrades are what it's all about, and its good even when the high price point</li>
                <li>heard of an pseudo-parody idea that people think software engineers that dress "nice" are worse coders - which seems like a pretty bad mindset to have - not a fan, even if it were a parody, but especially because I think people may somewhat believe in it in some subconscious way just because the sterotypical image people have</li>
              </ul>
            </br>
              <p>Education</p>
              <ul>
                <li>"D's get degrees" - changing culture around motivation/pride towards getting a good grade - balancing tradeoffs - caring just the right amount is important</li>
                <li>"teach us practical skills (like taxes)" - disagree with this argument - taxes are literally just filling out forms, it's not something like course material, ... education, even high school is about learning, developing interests, etc., not whether you'll use calculus or not, ... however, I agree that you shouldn't need to get involved into deeper level science/math if you don't want to, and that most students probably need more exposure to other non-stem classes like history, arts, etc.</li>
                <li>three big challenges of modern students: attention span, procrastination/motivation, anxiety/... sensory stimulation (tv on in background, music) while studying can be useful for attention span/in general, but only stuff you already know/have seen/heard</li>
                <li>student entitlement is a real issue: ...</li>
                <li>mental health: universities have some responsibility, but really they shouldn't be blamed - that responsibility is on the person themselves</li>
              </ul>
            </br>
              <p>Career</p>
              <ul>
                <li>the network success effect: seeing acquantices succeed in getting good jobs will always make you feel both jealous and have you compare yourself against what you think you know about them, no matter what type of person you are - people might think these jealous feelings are bad, but they subconsciously motivate you to be better</li>
              </ul>
            </br>
              <p>Cooking</p>
              <ul>
                <li>something that seems like it should be pretty intuitive in theory - put oil + spices + veggies/protein/... on a pan on some heat setting, and thats about it, buuut ...</li>
              </ul>
            </br>
              <p>Government-ish</p>
              <ul>
                <li>the tax system is broken - file returns that govt already has info on - except for maybe like up to 25% people have special cases, which can just be appended ... many other countries don't require these complex filings</li>
              </ul>
            </br>
              <p>Personal</p>
              <ul>
                <li>it's important to be empathetic to understand situations, but you still might have to/should do things that will cause issues with others</li>
                <li>a good nights sleep is so important, naps maybe less so, also the apple watch breathing app is pretty nice</li>
                <li>it's harder to work in the same room you sleep in/work while sitting in bed - bed is right there, incites that drowsiness - associate with sleeping not working</li>
              </ul>
            </br>
              <p>Understanding the World - innovation, economics, politics, history, statistics, psychology, philosophy, ... (some of the random interesting stories I've learned about through courses, reddit, twitter, linkedin, podcasts, books, movies, ...):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>(Outliers + other Malcolm Gladwell stuff; NPR Planet Money, Revisionist History, Freakonomics, Radiolab, Trailblazers, HBR IdeaCast, Gimlet Every Little Thing, Bloomberg Decrypted, WSJ The Future of Everything, NPR Hidden Brain, Marketplace Make Me Smart, Vox The Impact, Undiscovered; The Big Short, MoneyBall; West Wing, Newsroom)</li>
                <li>survivorship bias: world war planes, analyzing where to improve, planes coming back had holes in their wings, etc. - conventional thinking says build stronger wings; but planes were surviving when they had holes in their wings - hypothesis was planes that weren't surviving/coming back must've been shot in the other places...</li>
                <li>winner's curse in game theory</li>
                <li>Thinking about wages as the price/market of labour in economics</li>
                <li>LA city planning spread out experiment vs conventional like toronto/new york - skyscrapers, etc.</li>
                <li>applying aspects of known/expertise industries in unconventional ways to new/unfamiliar problems, e.g. story about chemist/biologist/? being able to innovate when working in field of manufacturing from Outliers (Malcolm Gladwell).</li>
                <li>Wildfire prevention involves setting controlled fires + reducing "more flamable" trees, which is such a weird thought since all trees are pretty flamable</li>
                <li>personal recycling is actually not really useful - might hurt more than just letting it degrade as trash in a landfill; many/most communities don't even do anything with your recycling, came about as a movement not really anything useful</li>
                <li>so much of the world works on other people's recommendations, it's a crazy part of being a human that hasn'tbeen captured entirely well by tech yet</li>
